# Morse-Code-Translator

Arduino program to convert alphanumeric text input into the serial monitor by the user into morse code using blinking an LED to denote different characters as defined by a convention (see link below)

Video attached shows the Morse Code Translation of "UBC engineering 2024" on the circuit board

 * according to standard convention for morse code:
    * if the time for a dot is set at 1 unit of time (100 milliseconds in this program)
    * the time for a dash is 3*unit time = 300 milliseconds 
    * the time between dot and dash in the same word is 1 unit of time = 100 milliseconds
    * the time for a space characted is 7*unit time = 700 milliseconds

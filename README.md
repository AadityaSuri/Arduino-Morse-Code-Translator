Aaditya Suri 41935511
Arduino program to convert alphanumeric text input for user into morse code using blinking of an LED

Video attached shows the Morse Code Translation of "UBC engineering 2024" on the circuit board

 * according to standard convention for morse code:
    * if the time for a dot is set at 1 unit of time (100 milliseconds in this program)
    * the time for a dash is 3*unit time = 300 milliseconds 
    * the time between dot and dash in the same word is 1 unit of time = 100 milliseconds
    * the time for a space characted is 7*unit time = 700 milliseconds
